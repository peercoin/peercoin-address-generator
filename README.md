# Peercoin Address Generator

This is the source-code of [paperwallet.peercoin.net](https://paperwallet.peercoin.net/), a secure client-side peercoin address generator.

It was built from ground up aiming for performance on mobile devices, but you can also use it on desktop browsers.

## Building locally

If you're concerned about generating your addresses online, there is always the option of building the project locally. The steps to do that are listed bellow:

0. Make sure you have [Node installed](https://gist.github.com/kazzkiq/fe702215173e795d49d0c1ffbea363b5).
1. Clone this repo;
2. In the project folder, run `npm install`;
3. Then run `npm start`.
4. Open `localhost:3333` in your browser and generate your wallet.

# Running wallet via docker - Instructions

1. Clone this repo **locally** on **master branch** and run build instructions;
2. Clone this repo **on server** on **docker branch**;
3. Copy `/public` content from **local** to `/public` folder on **docker branch** you cloned in **server**;
4. Run: `docker build -t ppc-wallet .`;
5. Run: `docker run --name ppc-wallet-nginx --restart on-failure -p 5001:80 ppc-wallet`.

The Reverse-proxy and SSL files are located on local NGINX (outside of docker). They can be found at: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`.

SSL is generated by Let's Encrypt via certbot.

The URLs addressed are:

https://hodl.peercoin.net/
https://paperwallet.peercoin.net/

In order to update SSL certificate, run the command below:

```
sudo systemctl stop nginx && sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d hodl.peercoin.net -d paperwallet.peercoin.net && sudo systemctl start nginx
```

The configuration used at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` is:
